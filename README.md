# DIABLO
### DIABLO - Database Influenced Automated Ban List of Offenders. 
DIABLO syncs up with our pre-existing databases on predators, such as pedophiles and zoophiles, and prevents them from joining servers that have DIABLO. 
Keep your server safe from  any potential predators with DIABLO.

Our bot is designed to source data from the public to create a comprehensive database which can potentially later be used to create a network of bots that can be used to close off any entrances that predators might walk through. The more doors we close on predators, we progress towards deplatformation of certain groups such as pedophiles and zoophiles from ever spreading their abusive ideology across the internet and affecting vulnerable individuals.
